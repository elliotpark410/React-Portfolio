    "aboutme":"My journey into coding began with the Full Stack Web Development bootcamp at the University of California, Berkeley. Despite the sleepless nights, every moment was worth it. The thrill of deploying my first app ignited a passion within me, solidifying my decision to pursue coding as a lifelong career. I thrive on learning about emerging technologies and relish the challenge of solving complex problems. With nearly two years of experience as a Full Stack Developer, I've had the opportunity to contribute to a wide range of projects, including the design of customer-facing websites and the development of RESTful API endpoints for a fintech mobile app. One of my proudest achievements has been successfully integrating the server with third-party APIs to implement essential features such as transaction confirmation, P2P transfers, and push notifications. At Jagad, where I currently work as a Node Developer, I've honed my skills in building secure and scalable API endpoints that adhere to strict security standards. I've collaborated with cross-functional teams to identify partnership requirements and develop open API features for payment gateway capability. When I'm not immersed in code, you can find me riding the waves at the beach or practicing jiu jitsu on the mats. I thrive on new challenges and am always eager to expand my horizons. Don't hesitate to reach out — I'm excited to connect and share more about my journey in tech!",
