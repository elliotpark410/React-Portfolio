    "aboutme":"My journey into coding began with University of California, Berkeley's Full Stack Web Development bootcamp. There were a lot of sleepless nights, but it was worth every second. After I deployed my first app, I was hooked and I knew this is what I wanted to do for the rest of my life. Currently, I am helping build the backend for Jagad which provides a decentralized stablecoin pegged to the Indonesian rupiah. I grew up in Southern California, lived in the Bay Area for a few years, and I am living in Bali, Indonesia. If I am not in front of my computer you can find me surfing at the beach or doing jiu jitsu on the mats. Please don't hesitate to reach out, and thank you for checking out my portfolio!",
