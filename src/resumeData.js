    "aboutme":"My journey into coding began with University of California, Berkeley's Full Stack Web Development bootcamp. There were a lot of sleepless nights, but it was worth every second. After I deployed my first app, I was hooked and I knew this is what I wanted to do for the rest of my life. I thoroughly enjoy learning about new technologies and solving difficult problems. While hard engineering problems are often fun to tackle, I'm most attracted to solving real customer problems with a business justification. Currently, I am helping build the frontend and backend for Jagad which provides a decentralized payment system. If I am not in front of my computer you can find me surfing at the beach or doing jiu jitsu on the mats. Please don't hesitate to reach out, and thank you for checking out my portfolio!",
